          arrange the meal with the appropriate dishware and condiments on a room service tray. It's an in-room dining
          best practice to offer guests a rolling room service table in case they don't want to eat in bed. </p>

            Hotels typically provide a room service menu that includes a variety of food and beverage options. The menu
            often includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and drinks. Some hotels may also offer 24-hour room
            service, allowing guests to order at any time.</p>

          <p>Guests can place their room service orders by calling the hotel's designated room service extension or by
            filling out an order form in their room. The order is then prepared by the hotel's kitchen staff and
            delivered to the guest's room.</p>

          <p> The delivery time for room service can vary depending on factors such as hotel occupancy, kitchen
            workload, and the complexity of the order. Hotels usually provide an estimated delivery time when the order
            is placed.</p>

          <p> Room service often incurs additional charges beyond the cost of the food or beverage. These charges may
            include delivery fees, service charges, and gratuities. It's important to check the hotel's policy regarding
            additional fees before placing an order.

            Special Requests: Most hotels can accommodate special dietary requests or specific </p>

          <p>Room service charges are typically added to the guest's hotel bill. Upon checkout, guests can settle the
            total bill, including the room service charges, using their preferred payment method.</p>
